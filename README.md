# extractVideoInfo
Extract_MV project aims to extract detailed compression information from a video such as motion vectors, quantization scales, coded tree structures, residuals, prediction errors etc. and provide a library to show those to the user. 

It currently supports Mpeg1,2, h264 and HEVC (H265) codecs. Extracted info is limited now, mostly only Motion vectors. However, the developed structure lets other users to get any other information from the codec by adding few lines of codes.

This is an open source project. We need people to contribute.
